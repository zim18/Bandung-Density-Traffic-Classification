> Traffic congestion is a condition when the number of vehicles traveling exceeds the available road capacity. This density is one of the causes of congestion that occurs especially in big cities. In this project, traffic density will be classified with Convolutional Neural Network model using EfficientNet Architecture using image dataset collected from Bandung City road intersections manually through Website CCTV Pemantauan Lingkungan Kota Bandung (PELINDUNG).

### Methodology
> In creating this project, the method we used is EfficientNet. EfficientNet is a state-of-the-art CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) architecture designed to enhance performance through a systematic scaling method. This approach improves the balance between depth, width, and resolution within the model, leading to more efficient and accurate outcomes.

> EfficientNet ingeniously integrates the strengths of MobileNet and ResNet models to construct a highly efficient model that excels in understanding high-quality images. One of the standout features of EfficientNet is its use of compound scaling, which adeptly addresses the challenges associated with ineffective scaling in conventional convolutional models. By scaling all dimensions of the network (depth, width, and resolution) simultaneously and in a principled manner, EfficientNet achieves superior performance with fewer computational resources.

### Dashboard
Here is the link to the dashboard where you can implement the model we have developed. This interactive platform allows you to upload and test traffic images to determine the type and level of congestion. By utilizing our model, you can gain insights into traffic conditions, helping to make informed decisions based on the congestion type identified by the model.
